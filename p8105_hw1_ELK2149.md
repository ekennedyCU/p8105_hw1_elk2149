**Problem 1**

The variables in this dataset are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

Flights were recorded from early Jan 2013. The average temperature
across this span of time was 39.5821229 °F.

The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

The following is a scatter plot of temperature by date and hour across
early Jan.

Temperature and humidity appear to be increasing over time, with daily
fluctuation, and humidity peaking around Jan 14th.

**Problem 2**

The below code samples 10 variables from a normal distribution,
evaluates how many of these variables are above zero, creates a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of three different
“levels”.

``` r
#Generating normal distribution, evaluating which are above 0, creating a character vector, and factor vector.

pb_2 = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Level 1", "Level 1", "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 2", "Level 2", "Level 3", "Level 3", "Level 3", "Level 3"))
)    

pb_2
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp norm_samp_pos vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>         <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1     0.879 TRUE          One      Level 1   
    ##  2    -1.59  FALSE         Two      Level 1   
    ##  3     0.924 TRUE          Three    Level 1   
    ##  4    -1.10  FALSE         Four     Level 2   
    ##  5    -1.12  FALSE         Five     Level 2   
    ##  6    -0.556 FALSE         Six      Level 2   
    ##  7    -1.43  FALSE         Seven    Level 3   
    ##  8    -0.751 FALSE         Eight    Level 3   
    ##  9    -1.17  FALSE         Nine     Level 3   
    ## 10     1.21  TRUE          Ten      Level 3

The below code takes the mean of each variable.

``` r
mean_norm_samp <- pb_2 |> # mean of the variables
  pull(norm_samp) |>    # extracts the "norm_samp" column
  mean()

mean_norm_samp
```

    ## [1] -0.4702767

``` r
mean_norm_samp_pos <- pb_2 |> # mean of how many are above 0
  pull(norm_samp_pos) |>    # extracts the "norm_samp_pos" column
  mean()

mean_norm_samp_pos
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean_vec_char <- pb_2 |> # attempted mean of the character vector
  pull(vec_char) |>    # extracts the "vec_char" column
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(pb_2, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor<- pb_2 |> # attempted mean fo the factor vector
  pull(vec_factor) |>    # extracts the "vec_factor" column
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(pb_2, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

You cannot take a mean of the non-numeric character and factor
variables, so it returns as NA. The mean of mean_norm_samp_pos is
actually the proportion of variables that are above zero.

``` r
mean_norm_samp_pos <- pb_2 |> 
  pull(norm_samp_pos) |>    # extracts the "norm_samp_pos" column
  as.numeric() |>   # converts to numeric value
  mean()

mean_vec_char <- pb_2 |> 
  pull(vec_char) |>    # extracts the "vec_char" column
  as.numeric() |>   # converts to numeric value
  mean()

mean_vec_factor<- pb_2 |> 
  pull(vec_factor) |>    # extracts the "vec_factor" column
  as.numeric() |>     # converts to numeric value
  mean()
```

You can use as.numeric to convert factors, and some characters into
numeric values. Because I spelled out my character numbers (one - ten),
rather than using 1-10, this didn’t work for the character vector.
